#' Find the three rotation angles about new axes in the xyz order from a rotation matrix
#'
#' The angles (called Euler angles or Taitâ€“Bryan angles) are defined by the
#' following procedure of successive rotations:
#' Given two arbitrary coordinate frames A and B, consider a temporary frame
#' T that initially coincides with A. In order to make T align with B, we
#' first rotate T an angle x about its x-axis (common axis for both A and T).
#' Secondly, T is rotated an angle y about the NEW y-axis of T. Finally, T
#' is rotated an angle z about its NEWEST z-axis. The final orientation of
#' T now coincides with the orientation of B.
#' The signs of the angles are given by the directions of the axes and the
#' right hand rule.

#' @param R_AB a 3x3 rotation matrix (direction cosine matrix) such that the
#'             relation between a vector v decomposed in A and B is
#'             given by: v_A = R_AB * v_B
#'
#' @return x,y,z 	Angles of rotation about new axes (rad)
