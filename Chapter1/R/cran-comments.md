## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. As request by the CRAN maintainer in this version I have:

* written Title in title case in DESCRIPTION file
* written package names, software names and API names in single quotes,
  e.g. 'Matlab' in Description in DESCRIPTION file
* unwrapped the example in `n_E_and_wa2R_EL.R` from \dontrun{}


## Test environments
* local Windows 7 x64 SP 1, R version 3.5.2 (2018-12-20)
* Ubuntu 14.04 (on TraviCI), R version 3.5.2 (2017-01-27)
* Windows Server 2012 R2 x64 (on Appveyor), R version 3.5.2 Patched (2019-02-17 r76122)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs or NOTEs.

## Downstream dependencies
This is a new package which as such has not yet been used by any other one on CRAN.
