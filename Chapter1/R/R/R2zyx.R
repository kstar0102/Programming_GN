#' Find the three angles about new axes in the zyx order from a rotation matrix
#'
#' The 3 angles \code{z}, \code{y}, \code{x} about new axes (intrinsic) in the order z-y-x are
#' found from the rotation matrix \code{R_AB}. The angles (called Euler angles or
#' Taitâ€“Bryan angles) are defined by the following procedure of successive rotations:
#' \enumerate{
#'  \item Given two arbitrary coordinate frames A and B, consider a temporary frame
#'        T that initially coincides with A. In order to make T align with B, we
#'        first rotate T an angle z about its z-axis (common axis for both A and T).
#'  \item Secondly, T is rotated an angle y about the NEW y-axis of T. Finally, T
#'        is rotated an angle x about its NEWEST x-axis.
#'  \item The final orientation of T now coincides with the orientation of B.
#' }
#' The signs of the angles are given by the directions of the axes and the right hand rule.
#'
#' Note that if A is a north-east-down frame and B is a body frame, we
#' have that z=yaw, y=pitch and x=roll.
#'
#' @param R_AB a 3x3 rotation matrix (direction cosine matrix) such that the
#'             relation between a vector v decomposed in A and B is
#'             given by: v_A = R_AB * v_B
#'
#' @return z,y,x angles of rotation about new axes (rad)
