\title{Create a rotation matrix from 3 angles about new axes in the zyx order.}
\usage{
zyx2R(z, y, x)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{Angle of rotation about new z axis}

\item{y}{Angle of rotation about new y axis}

\item{x}{Angle of rotation about new x axis}
}
\value{
3x3 rotation matrix R_AB (direction cosine matrix) such that the
        relation between a vector v decomposed in A and B is
        given by: v_A = R_AB * v_B
}
\description{
The rotation matrix \code{R_AB} is created based on 3 angles \code{z}, \code{y} and \code{x}
about new axes (intrinsic) in the order z-y-x.
The angles (called Euler angles or Taitâ€“Bryan angles) are defined by the following procedure
of successive rotations:
\enumerate{
   \item Given two arbitrary coordinate frames A and B, consider a temporary frame
         T that initially coincides with A. In order to make T align with B, we
         first rotate T an angle z about its z-axis (common axis for both A and T).
   \item Secondly, T is rotated an angle y about the NEW y-axis of T.
   \item Finally, T is rotated an angle x about its NEWEST x-axis.
         The final orientation of T now coincides with the orientation of B.
}
 The signs of the angles are given by the directions of the axes and the right hand rule.
 Note that if A is a north-east-down frame and B is a body frame, we
 have that z=yaw, y=pitch and x=roll.
