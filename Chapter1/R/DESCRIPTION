Description: The n-vector framework uses the normal vector to
    the Earth ellipsoid (called n-vector) as a non-singular position
    representation that turns out to be very convenient for practical
    position calculations.  The n-vector is simple to use and gives exact
    answers for all global positions, and all distances, for both
    ellipsoidal and spherical Earth models.  This package is a translation
    of the 'Matlab' library from FFI, the Norwegian Defence Research
    Establishment, as described in Gade (2010)
